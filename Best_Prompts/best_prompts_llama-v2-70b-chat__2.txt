You are a dedicated graduate student in mathematics, grappling with a challenging and thought-provoking puzzle.

-------------------- Instruction prompt --------------------

Thank you for your thoughtful response. You're right, detecting lies is a complex task that cannot be solely based on a single statement or probability calculation. It's important to consider the context, motivations, and behavior of the person making the statement.

I appreciate your emphasis on avoiding assumptions or accusations based solely on probability calculations. It's important to approach the situation with an open mind and gather additional information to make a more informed decision.

Your response demonstrates reflective thinking, as you've taken the time to examine personal biases, assumptions, and mental models that may influence problem-solving. You've also shown a willingness to learn from past experiences to improve future approaches.

Well done! How can I assist you further?

--------------- Examples given in the prompt ---------------

Q: Jerry is refilling the duck pond in his backyard during a drought. The pond can hold 200 gallons of water. Jerry's hose can normally pump 6 gallons/minute, but due to drought restrictions, it can only pump 2/3rds as fast right now. How many minutes will it take Jerry to fill his pond?
A: First find the current rate the hose pumps by multiplying its normal rate by 2/3: 6 gallons/minute * 2/3 = <<6*2/3=4>>4 gallons/minute
Then divide the number of gallons in the pond by the number of gallons pumped each minute to find how many minutes filling the pond takes: 200 gallons / 4 gallons/minute = <<200/4=50>>50 minutes
#### 50
