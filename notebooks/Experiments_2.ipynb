He wants to plant 2 apple trees that will be 10 feet wide each and need 12 feet between them.  The peach trees will be closer to the house and will grow to be 12 feet wide and will need 15 feet between each tree.  All told, how much space will these trees take up in his yard?\\nA: Both apple trees will be 10 feet wide at maturity so they will be 2*10 = <<10*2=20>>20 feet wide\\nQuinton will need to leave 12 feet between these 2 trees so the apple trees will take up 20+12 = 32 feet\\nBoth peach trees will be 12 feet wide at maturity so they will be 2*12 = <<12*2=24>>24 feet wide\\nQuinton will need to leave 15 feet between these 2 trees so the peach trees will take up 24+15 = 39 feet\\nTogether, the apple trees will take up 32 feet and the peach trees will take up 39 feet so they will take 32+39 = <<32+39=71>>71 feet\\n#### 71 \\nQ: A certain store sells computer accessories and equipment. Due to a fire outbreak in one of the factories, the price of RAM increased by 30%. After two years, the price stabilized and finally fell by 20% from what it has risen. What is the current price of RAM if it was $50 before the fire?\\nA: After the fire outbreak, the price of RAM got increased by 30/100 * 50 = $<<30/100*50=15>>15.\\nSo before stabilization the price was at 50 + 15 = $<<50+15=65>>65.\\nAfter the stabilization, the price fell by 20% from $65, so it fell by 20/100 * 65 = $<<20/100*65=13>>13.\\nThat means the RAM is currently at 65 - 13 = $<<65-13=52>>52.\\n#### 52 \\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\\nA: Ann and Becky have worked for 8 hours each, so both of them worked for 2 people * 8 hours/person = <<2*8=16>>16 hours.\\nAll three of them, including Julia, were working for 16 hours + 6 hours = 22 hours.\\nSo in total, they all have served 7 customers/hour * 22 hours = <<7*22=154>>154 customers in one day.\\n#### 154 \\n', 'problem': 'Q: Sidney does 20 jumping jacks on Monday, 36 on Tuesday, 40 on Wednesday, and 50 on Thursday.
