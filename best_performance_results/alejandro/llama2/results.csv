"(""Thank you for your thoughtful response. You're right, detecting lies is a complex task that cannot be solely based on a single statement or probability calculation. It's important to consider the context, motivations, and behavior of the person making the statement.\nI appreciate your emphasis on avoiding assumptions or accusations based solely on probability calculations. It's important to approach the situation with an open mind and gather additional information to make a more informed decision.\nYour response demonstrates reflective thinking, as you've taken the time to examine personal biases, assumptions, and mental models that may influence problem-solving. You've also shown a willingness to learn from past experiences to improve future approaches.\nWell done! How can I assist you further?"", 'You are a dedicated graduate student in mathematics, grappling with a challenging and thought-provoking puzzle.', '', 0)",100,0.05
