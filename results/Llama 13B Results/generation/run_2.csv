"('After giving some away to John, she is left with y marbles. We know that x - y = 6 (since she has 6 marbles left). We also know that y = 0 (since she has no marbles left after giving them all away). So, we can set up the equation x - 0 = 6. The solution is x = 6, meaning Jane had 6 marbles initially.', 'Choose a topic related to mathematics or logical thinking.', 'Think about this step by step.', 2)",30,0.16666666666666666
