Q: Voltaire and Leila are vloggers, Voltaire has an average of 50 viewers per day while Leila has twice the number of viewers Voltaire has. If they earn $0.50 per view, how much does Leila earn per week?
A: Leila has 50 x 2 = <<50*2=100>>100 viewers per day.
So, she earns 100 x $0.50 = $<<100*0.5=50>>50 per day.
Therefore, Leila earns $50 x 7 = $<<50*7=350>>350 every week.
#### 350Q: Antoinette weighs 7 less kilograms than twice Rupert's weight. Together they weigh 98 kilograms. How many kilograms does Antoinette weigh?
A: Let R = Rupert's weight
Antoinette = 2R - 7
R + 2R - 7 = 98
3R = 105
Rupert = <<35=35>>35 kg
Antoinette = 2 * 35 - 7 = <<2*35-7=63>>63 kg
Antoinette weighs 63 kilograms.
#### 63Q: It costs $.10 to print one page. Jenny wants to print 7 copies of her 25-page essay. She also wants to buy 7 pens that each cost $1.50. If she pays the store with 2 twenty dollar bills, how much money should she get in change?
A: Jenny needs to print 7*25= <<7*25=175>>175 pages.
This will cost 175*$.10 =$<<175*.10=17.5>>17.5.
The pens will cost 7*$1.50=$<<7*1.5=10.50>>10.50.
In total, she will spend $17.5+$10.5=$<<17.5+10.5=28>>28.
Since she pays with 2 twenty dollar bills she pays with 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 dollars.
Thus, she will get $40-$28=$<<40-28=12>>12 in change.

You're a math educator providing clear, practical guidance.

-------------------- Instruction prompt --------------------

To solve this mathematical problem, we can analyze the given information and use logical reasoning. 

Let's denote the original number of apples Jane has as "J" and the original number of apples John has as "2J" since John has twice as many apples as Jane.

According to the problem statement, if Jane gives John 5 apples, they will have an equal amount. This means that after this exchange, Jane and John will have the same number of apples.

Using this information, we can set up the following equation:
J - 5 = 2J + 5

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

J - 5 = 2J + 5  (subtract J from both sides)
-5 = J + 5 (subtract 5 from both sides)
-10 = J

Therefore, Jane originally has -10 apples. However, a negative number of apples is not possible in this context. Therefore, we can conclude that there is no solution to this problem given the information provided.

Please note that in a real-life scenario, it is important to critically assess the problem and evaluate whether the information provided is feasible or realistic. In this case, the inconsistency of the solution indicates that there might be an error or missing information in the problem statement.

Additionally, as a professional statistician, I would gather relevant data to further analyze and understand the problem. This would involve collecting data on obesity rates, demographics, socioeconomic factors, access to recreational facilities and nutritious food options, cultural norms, advertising influence, and other relevant variables.

I would then use statistical techniques to analyze this data and identify patterns, correlations, and causal relationships. This could involve conducting regression analyses, hypothesis testing, and other statistical modeling techniques.

By utilizing data analysis, I would be able to quantify the impact of different factors on obesity rates and identify key drivers of the problem. This would assist in prioritizing interventions and designing targeted solutions. I could also use data visualization techniques to present these findings in a clear and understandable manner.

Furthermore, as a professional statistician, I would emphasize the importance of ongoing data collection and monitoring to measure the effectiveness of implemented interventions. By regularly evaluating the impact of interventions and adjusting strategies accordingly, the system can be continually improved and adapted to address the changing dynamics of the problem.

In summary, a professional statistician approaching the problem of rising obesity rates with a systems thinking perspective would emphasize the analysis of interconnected factors, the identification of underlying causes and feedback loops, and the use of data to inform decision-making and evaluate interventions. This holistic approach provides a rigorous and data-focused perspective that is crucial for effective problem-solving.
