# JHU-LLM-Project
Final Project for the LLM class

Current status:

Nov 19: A working mechanism that mutates and judges prompt, given a task.

Improvements:

1. Add CI into the score. This helps avoid the situation where a nascent gene takes over a good old gene because of CI. Best to use score - CI for judgement.
2. Load other types of model, not just the current 7 billion parameter model (Done).
