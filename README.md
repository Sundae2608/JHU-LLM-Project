# JHU-LLM-Project
Final Project for the LLM class

Current status:
1. We have a working mutation mechanism that improves a bit from the baseline.

Goal:
1. Keep doing more in the mutation algorithms.
2. Do evaluation on multiple models. GPT-4, GPT-3.5 and a bunch of local models (LLama & Mistral).
3. Do it on a few more tasks.
4.
